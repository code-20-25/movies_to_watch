  <article>
  <p> The Shawshank Redemption is considered a great film because it tells a powerful story about hope, perseverance, and the human spirit in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds, with a well-crafted plot, strong character development, and a deeply relatable theme of overcoming injustice, making it resonate with audiences on a profound level.</p>
    <p>Many also praise its excellent acting, particularly from Morgan Freeman as the narrator, and the satisfyingly well-executed escape plan at the end. </p>
  <p>Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison for the murders of his wife and her lover and is sentenced to a tough prison.
  However, only Andy knows he didn't commit the crimes. While there, he forms a friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman), experiences brutality of prison life, adapts, helps the warden, etc., all in 19 years.
